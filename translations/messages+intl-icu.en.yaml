      <h2>Magento Extension Software License Agreement</h2>
      <p>Last updated on 24/06/2023</p>
      <h3>1. General Introduction</h3>
      <p>This document describes the software usage license agreements signed by a Customer upon purchasing a Magento Extension developed by the Owner of the store.magentify.it. Any violation of this agreement by the Customer automatically nullifies their rights to use the software or any parts thereof.</p>
      <h3>2. License</h3>
      <p>By purchasing a Magento Extension from the Store Owner, a Customer obtains a license to use it as long as they comply with the terms and conditions described in this agreement.</p>
      <p>Each license can be used on an unlimited number of Magento test installations and on <strong>one production installation</strong>. A license can be used in a multi-domain context as long as the various domains point to the same Magento production installation.</p>
      <p>The purchase of a license does not grant the Customer any ownership rights, either to the original software or any derivative thereof.</p>
      <h3>3. Installation</h3>
      <p>By purchasing a Magento Extension, the Customer agrees to take responsibility for its installation. The Store Owner cannot be held liable if the installation fails due to causes outside the module or depends on the specific configuration of the Customer's Magento platform. In case of installation issues, the Store Owner may choose to provide free assistance or suggest purchasing a paid installation service. However, <strong>the Store Owner guarantees a full refund if the Customer is dissatisfied, provided that the refund request is formally made within 10 days of purchase</strong>. Once a refund is issued for an Extension, the corresponding license is revoked, and the Customer loses all rights to use it in both testing and production environments.</p>
      <h3>4. Support</h3>
      <p><strong>For each purchased Extension, the Store Owner guarantees free updates and bug fixes for a period of three months from the purchase date</strong>. Free support does not include resolving issues related to installation or compatibility with third-party Extensions or customizations. Free support cannot be guaranteed if the Extension's source code has been modified. To obtain free support, the Customer must request it by providing evidence of the purchase, such as the transaction ID and the email used during the purchase process. The Store Owner reserves the right to ignore any support requests that do not comply with the described guidelines. At the end of the free support period, the Store Owner may offer a paid support service upon explicit request from the Customer.</p>
      <h3>5. Limitations of Liability</h3>
      <p>Except as otherwise provided by local laws, under no circumstances shall the Store Owner or any affiliated companies be liable for any damages, including loss of profit, data, or connectivity, arising from the use or inability to use this software.</p>
      <h3>6. Copyright</h3>
      <p>The Customer is not authorized to copy, sell, rent, or sublicense the software or any parts thereof without prior written authorization from the Store Owner.</p>
      <p>The Customer is not authorized to modify the source code of the software without prior written authorization from the Store Owner.</p>
      <p>Any violation of the described terms and conditions automatically grants the Store Owner the right to suspend the license, while informing the Customer of the resolution procedures for the ongoing issues. If the Customer disregards the Store Owner's instructions or persists in violating the license agreements, the Store Owner has the right to permanently revoke the license from the Customer.</p>
      <p>The source code and all files provided with an Extension are and remain the exclusive property of the Store Owner, subject to the regulations provided by Italian legislation regarding copyright.</p>
      <p>In the event of legal disputes, the Store Owner designates the exclusive competent jurisdiction as the Court of Reggio Emilia (Italy).</p>
      <h3>7. Modifications</h3>
      <p>The Store Owner reserves the right to unilaterally modify the terms and conditions described here, committing to communicate such changes to the Customers in the case of more restrictive or detrimental modifications.</p>
